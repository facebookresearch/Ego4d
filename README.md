# Ego4D

EGO4D is the world's largest egocentric (first person) video ML dataset and benchmark suite, with 3,600 hrs (and counting) of densely narrated video and a wide range of annotations across five new benchmark tasks.  It covers hundreds of scenarios (household, outdoor, workplace, leisure, etc.) of daily life activity captured in-the-wild by 926 unique camera wearers from 74 worldwide locations and 9 different countries.  Portions of the video are accompanied by audio, 3D meshes of the environment, eye gaze, stereo, and/or synchronized videos from multiple egocentric cameras at the same event.  The approach to data collection was designed to uphold rigorous privacy and ethics standards with consenting participants and robust de-identification procedures where relevant.
