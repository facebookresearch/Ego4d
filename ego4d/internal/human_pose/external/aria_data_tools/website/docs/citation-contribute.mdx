## Aria Research Kit: Aria Data Tools  and Aria Pilot Dataset White Paper

While our emphasis for this release has been creating detailed documentation that can be navigated in a non-linear fashion, a white paper is in development. The white paper will cover many of the features documented, with more of an emphasis on mathematics and calculations, rather than code and tooling. The white paper will also provide more detail about the Project Aria device program.

Once the white paper is complete, it will be linked to on this page.
