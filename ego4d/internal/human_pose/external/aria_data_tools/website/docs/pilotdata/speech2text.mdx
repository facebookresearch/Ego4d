# Speech2Text Output Data

Speech2Text Output Data provides text strings generated by Automatic Speech Recognition with timestamps and confidence rating.

Each recording has two .csv files that are the same, except  `speech2text/speech.csv` uses the wav file time domain and  `speech2text/speech_aria_domain.csv` uses Aria time domain.
