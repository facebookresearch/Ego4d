# Location Output Data

Location Output Data shows the Project Aria deviceâ€™s position and orientation in the world across six dimensions of freedom.

Each recording has a corresponding `trajectory.csv file`, which contains the co-location data of the Project Aria device. The trajectory is saved by a series of timestamped transformations of the Project Aria device's left IMU relative to the world coordinates (frames). The transformations are saved in 1KHz, to give high transformation accuracy when interpolating the trajectory at any arbitrary timestamp.

To give co-location information across different recordings, trajectories from the same [location](/pilotdata/everyday/everyday.mdx) are all aligned into the same world frame. Trajectories from the same [sequence](/pilotdata/everyday/scripts.mdx) are all aligned into the same world frame. The origin of the world frames are arbitrarily defined. The gravity acceleration vector always points up in the z axis of the world frame.

The Location Output Dataset for each recording is stored in `location/trajectory.csv`
