# Everyday Activities File Structure

The Everyday Activities dataset contains multiple activity sequences for one to two Project Aria device users. We created recordings using scripts to represent all day activities with always on sensing.

Records for each location are stored in their own folder. Each location contains one or several script folders. The script folder contains a .csv file providing details about each sequence, as well as a folder for each sequence. Each sequence has one or several recording folders (one recording folder per Project Aria device wearer in the sequence).

Derived data is stored in .csv files and the raw sensor data is stored in `recording.vrs`

Each location folder contains the following assets:

```

    ├── data_summary.csv
    ├──  script_1
        ├── seq_1
            ├── recording_001

              | └── et_in_rgb_stream.csv
              ├── location

* `data_summary.csv` - details about all the scripts, sequences and recordings in this folder.
* `eyetracking` - contains [Eye Gaze Data](/pilotdata/reprojected-gaze.mdx)
* `location` - contains [Location Output Data](/pilotdata/location-output.mdx)
* `recording.vrs` - contains Project Aria raw sensor data
* `speech2text` - contains [Speech2Text Output Data](/pilotdata/speech2text.mdx)
* `synchronization` - contains [Multi-Users Data](/pilotdata/timestamps.mdx)

## Project Aria Raw Sensor Data

[Sensors and Measurements](/sensors-measurements.mdx) provides information about how sensors are named and labelled in the tooling, coordinate systems, time and units of measurement.

[How Project Aria Uses VRS](/aria-vrs.mdx) provides information about how the raw data is stored.
