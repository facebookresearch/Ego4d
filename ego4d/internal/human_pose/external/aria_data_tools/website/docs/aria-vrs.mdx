# **How Project Aria Uses VRS**

Project Aria chose [VRS](https://facebookresearch.github.io/vrs/) as its data container because it is a file format designed to record and playback streams of XR sensor data and supports huge file sizes. These VRS files contain streams of time-sorted records generated for each sensor, with one set of sensors per stream. Project Aria data uses VRS for features such as:

* Records are structured as a succession of typed content blocks.
* The `DataLayout` definitions of the metadata blocks in Project Aria VRS files are open sourced under [vrs/vrs/oss/aria](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vrs/tree/main/vrs/oss/aria). These definitions provide an overview of what information can be extracted for each stream from a Project Aria sequence.
* Streams contain `Configuration`, `State` and `Data` records, each with a timestamp in a common time domain for the whole file.
* Playback is optimized for timestamp order, which is key for network streaming.
* Random-access playback is supported via VRS

The Aria Research Kit: Aria Data Tools provides an interface to access the data via an abstraction (an X_provider string) that allows users to iterate through all the sensor recordings.

VRS is automatically installed when you install Aria Data Tools. [VRS](https://facebookresearch.github.io/vrs/) is an open tool with API documentation available on Github.
