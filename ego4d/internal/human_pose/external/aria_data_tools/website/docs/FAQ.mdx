## Installation
### How do I install Podman?

Depending upon your operating system, there are several ways to get [Podman](https://podman.io/). Here are some of the ways.


#### On Fedora or CentOS

```
$ sudo dnf install podman
```


#### macOS
```
$ brew install podman
```

#### debian or Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt-get install podman
```


### Configuring Podman as a virtual machine

You do not need to run Podman as a virtual machine, but it is an option. If you use your container as a virtual machine you probably need at least 4 CPUs, 8 GB ram and 200 GB of disk space.

Podman and Docker are very similar. For all the instructions below, replace the word podman with docker to make it work with Docker.

#### Check your container's VM settings
```
$ podman machine ls
NAME                     VM TYPE     CREATED      LAST UP            CPUS        MEMORY      DISK SIZE
podman-machine-default*  qemu        4 hours ago  Currently running  4           8.594GB     214.7GB
```


#### Configure settings
If you do not have  4 CPUs, 8 GB ram and 200 GB of disk space.

```
$ podman machine stop; podman machine rm
$ podman machine init -m 8192 --cpus=4 --disk-space=200 && podman machine start
```
