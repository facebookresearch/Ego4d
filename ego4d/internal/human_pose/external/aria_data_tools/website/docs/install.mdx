## What is it?

The Aria Research Kit: Aria Data Tools provides Python3 code and a C++ library to work with VRS files data and requires a C++17 compiler.

:::note

Aria Data Tools can be built and used in a container (Docker/Podman) or as a local build (CentOS/Debian/MacOS) on Unix distribution.

:::

## Get the code

Download the code by checking out this Github repository with git clone.


```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/Aria_data_tools.git
```



## Build (Container)
Itâ€™s easiest to install Aria Data Tools through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) containers. [Containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) allow developers to package an application together with libraries and other dependencies, allowing them to provide a self contained environment for running software services. Once Docker or Podman containers are set up, you can install Aria Data Tools with two commands.

* [Get started with Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [About Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/)
    * [Quick installation instructions](/FAQ.mdx)

The following terminal commands are given for Docker. If you are using Podman, replace Docker with Podman in the commands below.

Use these commands to install the Aria Data Tools, C++ library and Python3 code in a container, and then run a shell inside of that container.


```
$ docker build . --network=host -t aria_data_tools
$ docker run -it --volume <your_local_data>:/data aria_data_tools:latest
```

If you would like to run the visualization tools inside the container, you'll need to enable X11 forwarding between the host and the container.  To do so, run your container shell with the following commands:

```
% sudo xhost +
$ docker run -it -e DISPLAY  --volume <your_local_data>/data --network=host aria_data_tools:latest
```

For Podman on linux you can run:
```
podman run --rm -it -e DISPLAY --volume <your_local_data>/data -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --security-opt label=type:container_runtime_t  localhost/aria_data_tools:latest
```
