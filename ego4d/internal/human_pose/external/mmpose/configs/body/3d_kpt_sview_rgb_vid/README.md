# Video-based Single-view 3D Human Body Pose Estimation

Video-based 3D pose estimation is the detection and analysis of X, Y, Z coordinates of human body joints from a sequence of RGB images.
For single-person 3D pose estimation from a monocular camera, existing works can be classified into three categories:
(1) from 2D poses to 3D poses (2D-to-3D pose lifting)
(2) jointly learning 2D and 3D poses, and
(3) directly regressing 3D poses from images.
