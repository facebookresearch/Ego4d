This folder consists of:

1. a review interface in the `review/` directory
2. various recipes in the `recipes/` directory

## Review Interface

The `review/` folder was created via a create-react-app template.

```bash
$ npx create-react-app review --template mephisto-review
```

Most of the custom code added to the template will be found in either the `review/src/custom/`folder or `review/src/index.js`.

Therefore, if you'd like to update the version of the template to integrate upstream changes, you can easily do so by invoke `create-react-app` again as shown above and copying over the file and folder mentioned above.

## Recipes

See the [README](recipes/README.md) in the directory for more information of installation and prerequisites.
